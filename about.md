My name is Konstantinos and this is my personal blog and website about usually technical subjects I am interested in, related to computer science and mathematics.

Currently, I am a backend C# developer in the betting industry. I recently graduated from Chalmers University in Gothenburg with a Master's degree in Computer science. The master programme focused on theory and in particular, logic in various topics such as formal methods, programming language theory, and proof assistants based on type theory.

My go-to general purpose languages are Java and Haskell and I'm particularly interested in Agda, a dependently typed functional language used as a theorem prover.

Main interests:
- Programming languages.
- Functional and OO programming.
- Automated testing.
- Data Science.
- Software development methodologies.
- Proof assistants based in type theory.
- Lambda calculus and category theory.

### Education ###

I have a bachelor in computer science from the University of Sheffield with a thesis on sentiment analysis using supervised machine learning. 

Moreover, I attained a master's degree from Chalmers University of Technology. Μυ master's thesis was an Agda formalization of a categorical model of type theories, namely categories with families.

The formalization is public [here](https://github.com/superhaNds/cwfs).
The report can be viewed [here](/assets/documents/thesis.pdf).

### Other personal

I am Greek-Finnish raised in Thessaloniki, Greece. Hobbies & Interests include: basketball, American pool, gaming, philosophy, and recreational mathematics.
