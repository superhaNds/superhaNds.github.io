My name is Konstantinos and this my personal blog and website about 
usually technical subjects I am interested in related to computer science.

I'm a computer science masters student at Chalmers University in Gothenburg.
The master programme focused on theory and in particular, logic in various topics
such as formal methods, programming language theory, and proof assistants based
on type theory.

My go-to general purpose languages are Java and Haskell.

Main interests:
- Programming languages.
- Functional and OO programming.
- Software development methodologies.
- Proof assistants based in type theory.
- Lambda calculus and category theory.
