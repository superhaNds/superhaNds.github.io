My name is Konstantinos and this is my personal blog and website about usually technical subjects I am interested in, related to computer science and mathematics.

Currently, I am a backend C# developer in the betting industry.

My go-to general purpose languages are Java and Haskell and I'm particularly interested in Agda, a dependently typed functional language used as a theorem prover.

Main interests:
- Programming languages.
- Functional and OO programming.
- Automated testing.
- Data Science.
- Software development methodologies.
- Proof assistants based in type theory.
- Lambda calculus and category theory.

### Education ###

I have a bachelor in computer science from the University of Sheffield with a thesis on sentiment analysis using supervised machine learning. 

Moreover, I attained a master's degree from Chalmers University of Technology. Îœy master's thesis was an Agda formalization of a categorical model of type theories, namely categories with families.

The formalization is public [here](https://github.com/superhaNds/cwfs).
The report can be viewed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/thesis.pdf).
