My name is Konstantinos and this my personal blog and website about 
usually technical subjects I am interested in related to computer science.

I'm a computer science master student at Chalmers University in Gothenburg.
The master programme focused on theory and in particular, logic in various topics
such as formal methods, programming language theory, and proof assistants based
on type theory.

My go-to general purpose languages are Java and Haskell and I'm very interested
in Agda, a dependently typed functional language used as a theorem prover.

Main interests:
- Programming languages.
- Functional and OO programming.
- Automated testing
- Software development methodologies.
- Proof assistants based in type theory.
- Lambda calculus and category theory.

### Education ###

I have a bachelor in Computer Science with a thesis on sentiment analysis using
supervised machine learning. 

During the master's thesis at Chalmers I formalized in Agda a categorical model
of type theories, namely categories with families (CwFs). We defined
three notions: unityped, simply typed, and dependently typed CwFs and
implemented two term models for each. The implementation consisted of constructing
initial objects in the category of CwFs and isomorphisms between them.

The formalization is public [here](https://github.com/superhaNds/cwfs);

### Other personal

I am Greek-Finnish, raised in Thessaloniki. Hobbies include:
basketball, American pool, gaming, and video editing.
