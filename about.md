### Personal ###

Pretentious blog related mainly to computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.

I am currently a backend C# developer in the betting industry.

My go-to general purpose languages are Java and Haskell and I'm particularly interested in Agda, a dependently typed functional language used as a theorem prover.

Main interests:
- Programming languages.
- Functional and OO programming.
- Automated testing.
- Data Science.
- Software development methodologies.
- Proof assistants based in type theory.
- Lambda calculus and category theory.

### Education ###

- BSc in Computer Science (University of Sheffield).
- MSc in Computer Science (Chalmers University of Technology).
