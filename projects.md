## Master Thesis ##

During my master's thesis I formalized in Agda a categorical model
of type theories, namely categories with families (CwFs). We defined
three notions: untyped, simply typed, and dependently typed
lambda calculi and showed that they are modelled by the
equivalent formulation of a category with families. This implementation
consisted of constructing initial objects in the category of CwFs and
a proof of isomorphism between them.

The formalization is public [here](https://github.com/superhaNds/cwfs);
and the latest draft of the thesis [here]({{https://superhands.github.io/}}/assets/docs/msc_th.pdf).

## Bachelor Thesis ##

My bachelor thesis investigated sentiment analysis that aims to find
emotions expressed in natural language. This has important commercial
value as there exists an enormous dataset of posts throughout the internet
in forums, review sites, etc. We explored in particular the use of supervised
machine learning to tackle this problem by creating models for film reviews 
and general social network short posts. We used GATE, a text engineering tool
to train and test models and compare different approaching.

The thesis can be found [here]({{https://superhands.github.io/}}/assets/docs/bsc_th.pdf).
